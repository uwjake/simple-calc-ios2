      You will need some kind of "enter" key to indicate when the user is done entering a number
      
Note: my enter button is SPC, which stands for Space.

# Usage

## 1. Base Case: +, -, ...

Chain operation is available:

Press 1 + 2 + 3 = 

Must press "=" to see result, but no need for FACT operation

After press "=", calc will be stopped, if enter numbers now, new calc will init.

## 2. Decimal Case:

"." button is for decimal
